  <h>Hymn to Demeter</h>

<p>1          I begin to sing of Demeter, the holy goddess with the beautiful hair.<br>

            And her daughter too. The one with the delicate ankles, whom Hadês<br>

            seized. She was given away by Zeus, the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide.<br>

            Demeter did not take part in this, she of the golden double-axe, she who glories in the harvest.<br>

5          She was having a good time, along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear their girdles slung low.<br>

            She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets.<br>

            Up and down the soft meadow. Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth.<br>

            And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure for the flower-faced girl<br>

            by Gaia. All according to the plans of Zeus. She was doing a favor for the one who receives many guests.<br>

10         It was a wondrous thing in its splendor. To look at it gives a sense of holy awe<br><br>

            to the immortal gods as well as mortal humans.<br>

            It has a hundred heads growing from the root up.<br>

            Its sweet fragrance spread over the wide skies up above.<br>

            And the earth below smiled back in all its radiance. So too the churning mass of the salty sea.<br>

15         She was filled with a sense of wonder, and she reached out with both hands<br>

            to take hold of the pretty plaything. And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her.<br>

            It happened on the Plain of Nysa. There it was that the Lord who receives many guests made his lunge.<br>

            He was riding on a chariot drawn by immortal horses. The son of Kronos. The one known by many names.<br>

            He seized her against her will, put her on his golden chariot,<br>

20         And drove away as she wept. She cried with a piercing voice,<br>

                 calling upon her father, the son of Kronos, the highest and the best.<br>

                 But not one of the immortal ones, or of human mortals,<br>

            heard her voice. Not even the olive trees which bear their splendid harvest.<br>

            Except for the daughter of Persaios, the one who keeps in mind the vigor of nature.<br>

25         She heard it from her cave. She is Hekatê, with the splendid headband.<br>

            And the Lord Helios heard it too, the magnificent son of Hyperion.<br>

            They heard the daughter calling upon her father, the son of Kronos.<br>

            But he, all by himself,<br>

            was seated far apart from the gods, inside a temple, the precinct of many prayers.<br>

            He was receiving beautiful sacrificial rites from mortal humans.<br>

30         She was being taken, against her will, at the behest of Zeus,<br>

            by her father’s brother, the one who makes many sêmata, the one who receives many guests,<br>

            the son of Kronos, the one with many names. On the chariot drawn by immortal horses.<br>

            So long as the earth and the star-filled sky<br>

            were still within the goddess’s view, as also the fish-swarming sea, with its strong currents,<br>

35         as also the rays of the sun, she still had hope that she would yet see<br>

            her dear mother and that special group, the immortal gods.<br>

            For that long a time her great noos was soothed by hope, distressed as she was.<br>

            The peaks of mountains resounded, as did the depths of the sea,<br>

            with her immortal voice. And the Lady Mother heard her.<br>

40         And a sharp akhos seized her heart. The headband on her hair<br>

            she tore off with her own immortal hands<br>

            and threw a dark cloak over her shoulders.<br>

            She sped off like a bird, soaring over land and sea,<br>

            looking and looking. But no one was willing to tell her the truth,<br>

45         not one of the gods, not one of the mortal humans,<br>

            not one of the birds, messengers of the truth.<br>

            Thereafter, for nine days did the Lady Demeter<br>

            wander all over the earth, holding torches ablaze in her hands.<br>

            Not once did she take of ambrosia and nectar, sweet to drink,<br>

50         in her grief, nor did she bathe her skin in water.<br>

            But when the tenth bright dawn came upon her,<br>

            Hekatê came to her, holding a light ablaze in her hands.<br>

            She came with a message, and she spoke up, saying to her:<br>

            “Lady Demeter, bringer of hôrai, giver of splendid gifts,<br>

55         which one of the gods who dwell in the sky or which one of mortal humans<br>

            seized Persephone and brought grief to your philos thûmos?<br>

            I heard the sounds, but I did not see with my eyes<br>

            who it was. So I quickly came to tell you everything, without error.”<br>

            So spoke Hekatê. But she was not answered<br>

60         by the daughter of Rhea with the beautiful hair. Instead, she joined her and quickly<br>

            set out with her, holding torches ablaze in her hands.<br>

            They came to Hêlios, the seeing-eye of gods and men.<br>

            They stood in front of his chariot-team, and the resplendent goddess asked this question:<br>

            “Helios! Show me respect [aidôs], god to goddess, if ever<br>

65         I have pleased your heart and thûmos in word or deed.<br>

            It is about the girl born to me, a sweet young seedling, renowned for her beauty,<br>

            whose piercing cry I heard resounding through the boundless aether,<br>

            as if she were being forced, though I did not see it with my eyes.<br>

            I turn to you as one who ranges over all the earth and sea [pontos]<br>

70         as you look down from the bright aether with your sunbeams:<br>

            tell me without error whether you have by any chance seen my philon child,<br>

            and who has taken her away from me by force, against her will,<br>

            and then gone away? Tell me which one of the gods or mortal humans did it.”<br>

            So she spoke. And the son of Hyperion answered her with these words:<br>

75         “Daughter of Rhea with the beautiful hair, Queen Demeter!<br>

            You shall know the answer, for I greatly respect you and feel sorry for you<br>

            as you grieve over your child, the one with the delicate ankles. No one else<br>

            among all the immortals is responsible [aitios] except the cloud-gatherer Zeus himself,<br>

            who gave her to Hadês as his beautiful wife.<br>

            So he gave her to his own brother. And he [Hadês], heading for the misty realms of darkness,<br>

80         seized her as he drove his chariot and as she screamed out loud.<br>

            But I urge you, goddess: stop your loud cry of lamentation: you should not<br>

            have an anger without bounds, all in vain. It is not unseemly<br>

            to have, of all the immortals, such a son-in-law as Hadês, the one who makes many sêmata.<br>

85         He is the brother [of Zeus], whose seed is from the same place. And as for tîmê,<br>

            he has his share, going back to the very beginning, when the three-way division of inheritance was made.<br>

            He dwells with those whose king he was destined by lot to be.”<br>

            So saying, he shouted to his horses, and they responded to his command<br>

            as they swiftly drew the speeding chariot, like long-winged birds.<br>

90         And she was visited by grief that was even more terrible than before: it makes you think of the Hound of Hadês.<br>

            In her anger at the one who is known for his dark clouds, the son of Kronos,<br>

            she shunned the company of gods and lofty Olympus.<br>

            She went away, visiting the cities of humans, with all their fertile landholdings,<br>

            shading over her appearance, for a long time. And not one of men,<br>

95         looking at her, could recognize her. Not one of women, either, who are accustomed to wear their girdles low-slung.<br>

            Until, one day, she came to the house of bright-minded Keleos,<br>

            who was at that time ruler of Eleusis, fragrant with incense.<br>

            She sat down near the road, sad in her philon heart,<br>

            at the well called Parthenion [the Virgin’s Place], where the people of the polis used to draw water.<br>

100       She sat in the shade, under the thick growth of an olive tree,<br>

            looking like an old woman who had lived through many years and who is<br>

             deprived of giving childbirth and of the gifts of Aphrodite, lover of garlands in the hair.<br>

            She was like those nursemaids who belong to kings, administrators of themistes,<br>

            and who are guardians of children in echoing palaces.<br>

105       She was seen by the daughters of Keleos, son of Eleusinos,<br>

            who were coming to get water, easy to draw, in order to carry it<br>

            in bronze water-jars to the phila home of their father.<br>

            There were four of them, looking like goddesses with their bloom of adolescence:<br>

            Kallidikê, Kleisidikê, and lovely Dêmô.<br>

110       And then there was Kallithoê, who was the eldest of them all.<br>

            They did not recognize her [Demeter]. Gods are hard for mortals to see.<br>

            They [the daughters] stood near her and spoke these winged words:<br>

            “Who are you, and where are you from, old woman, old among old humans?<br>

            Why has your path taken you far away from the polis? Why have you not drawn near to the palace?<br>

115       There, throughout the shaded chambers, are women<br>

            who are as old as you are, and younger ones too,<br>

            who would welcome you in word and in deed.”<br>

            So she spoke.[8] And the Lady Goddess spoke with the following words:<br>

            “Phila children! Whoever women you are among the female kind of humans,<br>

120       I wish you kharis [‘I wish you pleasure and happiness from our relationship, starting now’]. I shall tell you. It is not unseemly,<br>

            since you ask, for me to tell you alêthea.<br>

            Dôsô[9] is my name. It was given to me by my honored mother.<br>

            But that was then. I am from Crete, having traveled over the wide stretches of sea<br>

            against my will. Without my consent, by biâ, by duress,<br>

125       I was abducted by pirates. After a while,<br>

            sailing with their swift ship, they landed at the harbor of Thorikos. There the ship was boarded by women<br>

            of the mainland, many of them. They<br>

            started preparing dinner next to the prow of the beached ship.<br>

            But my thûmos did not yearn for food, that delight of the mind.<br>

130       I stole away and set out to travel over the dark earth of the mainland, fleeing my arrogant captors. This way, I stopped them<br>

            from drawing any benefit from my worth without having paid the price.<br>

            That is how I got here, in the course of all my wanderings. And I do not know<br>

            what this land is and who live here.<br>

135       But I pray to all the gods who abide on Olympus that you be granted<br>

            vigorous husbands and that you be able to bear children,<br>

            in accordance with the wishes of your parents. As for me, young girls, take pity.<br>

            To be honest about it, what I want is for you to name for me a house to go to, the house of someone, man or woman, who has phila children to be taken care of.<br>

            I want to work for them,<br>

140       honestly. The kind of work that is cut out for a female who has outlived others her own age.<br>

            I could take some newborn baby in my arms,<br>

            and nourish him well. I could watch over his house.<br>

            I would make his bed in the inner recesses of well-built chambers,<br>

            the royal bed. And I could see to a woman’s tasks.”<br>

145       So spoke the goddess. And she was answered straightaway by the unwed maiden,<br>

            Kallidikê, the most beautiful of the daughters of Keleos:<br>

            “Old Mother, we humans endure the gifts the gods give us, even when we are grieving over what has to be.<br>

            They [the gods] are, after all, far better than we are.<br>

            What I now say will be clear advice, and I will name for you<br>

150       the men who have the great control, divinely given, of tîmê here:<br>

            the men who stand at the forefront of the dêmos and who protect the citadel of the polis<br>

            with their wise counsel and their straight dikai.<br>

            And then there are the wives too: of sound-minded Triptolemos, of Dioklos,<br>

            of Polyxenos, of faultless Eumolpos as well,<br>

155       of Dolikhos, and of our splendid father.<br>

            The wives of all of these manage the palace.<br>

            Of these women, not a single one of them, when they first look at you,<br>

            would deprive you of tîmê, the way you look, and turn you away from the palace.<br>

            Rather, they will receive you. For, right now, you look like the gods.<br>

160       If you wish, wait for us, while we go to the palace of our father<br>

            and tell our mother, Metaneira with the low-slung girdle,<br>

            all these things from beginning to end, in the hope that she will tell you<br>

            to come to our house and not to seek out the houses of others.<br>

            She has a treasured son, growing up in the well-built palace.<br>

165       He was born late, after many a prayer for the birth of a son: a great joy to his parents.<br>

            If you nourish him to grow till he reaches the crossing-point of life, coming of age,<br>

            I can predict that you will be the envy of any woman who lays eyes on you.<br>

            That is how much compensation she [Metaneira] would give you in return for raising him.”<br>

            So she [Kallidikê] spoke. And she [Demeter] nodded her assent. So they,<br>

170       filling their splendid jars with water, carried it off, looking magnificent.<br>

            Swiftly they came to the great palace of their father, and quickly they told their mother<br>

            what they saw and heard. And she told them<br>

            quickly to go and invite her [Demeter] for whatever wages, no limits,<br>

            and they, much as deer or heifers in the hôrâ of spring<br>

175       prance along the meadow, satiating their dispositions as they graze on the grass,<br>

            so also they, hitching up the folds of their lovely dresses,<br>

            dashed along the rutted roadway, their hair flowing<br>

            over their shoulders, looking like crocus blossoms.<br>

            They found the illustrious goddess sitting near the road, just the way<br>

180       they had left her. Then they led her to the phila palace of their father.<br>

            She was walking behind them, sad in her philon heart.<br>

            She was wearing a veil on her head, and a long dark robe <br>

            trailed around the delicate feet of the goddess.<br>

            Straightaway they came to the palace of sky-nurtured Keleos.<br>

185       They went through the hall, heading for the place where their mistress, their mother,<br>

            was sitting near the threshold of a well-built chamber,<br>

            holding in her lap her son, a young seedling. And they ran over<br>

            to her side. She [Demeter] in the meantime went over to the threshold and stood on it, with feet firmly planted, and her head<br>

            reached all the way to the ceiling. And she filled the whole indoors with a divine light.<br>

190       She [Metaneira] was seized by a sense of aidôs, by a holy wonder, by a blanching fear.<br>

            She [Metaneira] yielded to her [Demeter] the chair on which she was sitting, and she told her to sit down.<br>

            But Demeter, the bringer of hôrai, the giver of splendid gifts,<br>

            refused to sit down on the splendid chair,<br>

            but she stood there silent, with her beautiful eyes downcast,<br>

195       until Iambê, the one who knows what is worth caring about and what is not, set down for her<br>

            a well-built stool, on top of which she threw a splendid fleece.<br>

            On this she [Demeter] sat down, holding with her hands a veil before her face.<br>

            For a long time she sat on the stool, without uttering a sound, in her sadness.<br>

            And she made no approach, either by word or by gesture, to anyone.<br>

200       Unsmiling, not partaking of food or drink,<br>

            she sat there, wasting away with yearning for her daughter with the low-slung girdle,<br>

            until Iambê,[18] the one who knows what is dear and what is not, started making fun.<br>

            Making many jokes, she turned the Holy Lady’s disposition in another direction,<br>

            making her smile and laugh and have a merry thûmos.<br>

205       Ever since, she [Iambê] has been pleasing her [Demeter] with the sacred rites.<br>

            Then Metaneira offered her [Demeter] a cup, having filled it with honey-sweet wine.<br>

            But she refused, saying that it was divinely ordained that she not<br>

            drink red wine. Then she [Demeter] ordered her [Metaneira] to mix some barley and water<br>

            with delicate pennyroyal, and to give her [Demeter] that potion to drink.<br>

210       So she [Metaneira] made the kukeôn[19] and offered it to the goddess, just as she had ordered.<br>

            The Lady known far and wide as Dêô[20] accepted it, for the sake of the hosia.<br>

            Then well-girded Metaneira spoke up in their midst:<br>

            “Woman, I wish you kharis [‘I wish you pleasure and happiness from our relationship, starting now’]. I speak this way because I think you are descended not from base parents<br>

            but from noble ones. You have the look of aidôs in your eyes,<br>

215       and the look of kharis, just as if you were descended from kings, who uphold the themistes.<br>

            We humans endure the gifts the gods give us, even when we are grieving over what has to be.<br>

            The yoke has been placed on our neck.<br>

            But now that you have come here, there will be as many things that they give to you as they give to me.<br>

            Take this little boy of mine and nourish him. He is late-born, and it was beyond my expectations<br>

220       that the immortals could have given him to me. I prayed many times to have him.<br>

            If you nourish him to grow till he reaches the crossing-point of life, coming of age,<br>

            I can predict that you will be the envy of any woman who lays eyes on you.<br>

            That is how much compensation I [Metaneira] would give you in return for raising him.”<br>

            Then Demeter, with the beautiful garlands in her hair, addressed her:<br>

225       “Woman, I wish you kharis back, and then some. May the gods give you good things.<br>

            With positive intentions, I will take your little boy as you tell me to.<br>

            I will nourish him, and I do not expect that, through the inadvertence of her nursemaid,<br>

            he would perish from a pestilence or from the Undercutter.<br>

            I know an antidote[23] that is far more powerful than the Woodcutter;<br>

230       I know a genuine remedy for the painful pestilence.”<br>

            Having so spoken, she took the child to her fragrant bosom,<br>

            in her immortal hands. And the mother [Metaneira] rejoiced in her mind.<br>

            And thus it came to pass that the splendid son of bright-minded Keleos,<br>

            Dêmophôn,[25] who was born to well-girded Metaneira,<br>

235       was nourished in the palace, and he grew up like a daimôn,<br>

            not eating grain, not sucking from the breast. But Demeter<br>

            used to anoint him with ambrosia, as if he had been born of the goddess,<br>

            and she would breathe down her sweet breath on him as she held him to her bosom.<br>

            At nights she would conceal him within the menos of fire, as if he were a smoldering log,<br>

240       and his philoi parents were kept unaware. But they marveled<br>

            at how full in bloom he came to be, and to look at him was like looking at the gods.<br>

            Now Demeter would have made him ageless and immortal<br>

            if it had not been for the heedlessness of well-girded Metaneira,<br>

            who went spying one night, leaving her own fragrant bedchamber,<br>

245       and caught sight of it [what Demeter was doing]. She let out a shriek and struck her two thighs,<br>

            afraid for her child. She had made a big mistake in her thûmos.<br>

            Weeping, she spoke these winged words:<br>

            “My child! Demophon! The stranger, this woman, is making you disappear in a mass of flames!<br>

            This is making me weep in lamentation [goos]. This is giving me baneful anguish!”<br>

250       So she spoke, weeping. And the resplendent goddess heard her.<br>

            Demeter, she of the beautiful garlands in the hair, became angry at her.<br>

            She [Demeter] took her [Metaneira’s] philos little boy, who had been born to her mother in the palace, beyond her expectations,<br>

            —she took him in her immortal hands and put him down on the floor, away from her.<br>

            She had taken him out of the fire, very angry in her thûmos,<br>

255       and straightaway she spoke to well-girded Metaneira:<br>

            “Ignorant humans! Heedless, unable to recognize in advance<br>

            the difference between future good fortune [aisa] and future bad.<br>

            In your heedlessness, you have made a big mistake, a mistake without remedy.<br>

            I swear by the Styx,[29] the witness of oaths that gods make, as I say this<br>

260       immortal and ageless for all days<br>

            would I have made your philos little boy, and I would have given him tîmê that is unwilting.<br>

            But now there is no way for him to avoid death and doom.<br>

            Still, he will have a tîmê that is unwilting [a-phthi-tos], for all time, because he had once sat<br>

            on my knees and slept in my arms.<br>

265       At the right hôrâ, every year,<br>

            the sons of the Eleusinians will have a war, a terrible battle<br>

            among each other. They will do so for all days to come.<br>

            I am Demeter, the holder of tîmai. I am the greatest<br>

            boon and joy for immortals and mortals alike.<br>

270       But come! Let a great temple, with a great altar at its base,<br>

            be built by the entire dêmos. Make it at the foot of the acropolis and its steep walls.<br>

            Make it loom over the well of Kallikhoron,[33] on a prominent hill.<br>

            And I will myself instruct you in the sacred rites so that, in the future,<br>

            you may perform the rituals in the proper way and thus be pleasing to my noos.”<br>

275       So saying, the goddess changed her size[34] and appearance,<br>

            shedding her old age, and she was totally enveloped in beauty.<br>

            And a lovely fragrance wafted from her perfumed robes.<br>

            The radiance of her immortal complexion<br>

            shone forth from the goddess. Her blond hair streamed down her shoulder.<br>

280       The well-built palace was filled with light, as if from a flash of lightning.<br>

            She went out of the palace, and straightaway her [Metaneira’s] knees buckled.<br>

            For a long time she [Metaneira] was speechless. She did not even think of<br>

            her treasured little boy, to pick him up from the floor.<br>

            But his sisters heard his plaintive wailing,<br>

285       and they quickly ran downstairs from their well-cushioned bedrooms. One of them<br>

            picked up the child in her arms, clasping him to her bosom.<br>

            Another one rekindled the fire. Still another one rushed, with her delicate feet,<br>

            to prop up her mother as she was staggering out of the fragrant room.<br>

            They all bunched around the little boy, washing him as he gasped and spluttered.<br>

290       They all kept hugging him, but his thûmos could not be comforted.<br>

            He was now being held by nursemaids who were far inferior.<br>

            All night they prayed to the illustrious goddess,<br>

            trembling with fear. And when the bright dawn came,<br>

            they told Keleos, who rules far and wide, exactly what happened,<br>

295       and what the goddess Demeter, the one with the beautiful garlands in the hair, instructed them to do.<br>

            Then he [Keleos] assembled the masses of the people, from this end of the public place to the other,<br>

            and he gave out the order to build, for Demeter with the beautiful hair, a splendid temple,<br>

            and an altar too, on top of the prominent hill.<br>

            And they obeyed straightaway, hearing his voice.<br>

300       They built it as he ordered. And the temple grew bigger and bigger, taking shape through the dispensation of the daimôn.<br>

            When the people had finished their work and paused from their labor,<br>

            they all went home. But blond-haired Demeter<br>

            sat down and stayed there [in the temple], shunning the company of all the blessed ones.<br>

            She was wasting away with yearning for her daughter with the low-slung girdle.<br>

305       She made that year the most terrible one for mortals, all over the Earth, the nurturer of many.<br>

            It was so terrible, it makes you think of the Hound of Hadês. The Earth did not send up<br>

            any seed. Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in her hair, kept them covered underground..<br>

            Many a curved plough was dragged along the fields by many an ox—all in vain.<br>

            Many a bright grain of wheat fell into the earth—all for naught.<br>

310       At this moment, she could have destroyed the entire race of meropes humans<br>

            with harsh hunger, thus depriving of their time<br>

            the dwellers of the Olympian abodes—sacrificial portions of meat for eating or for burning,<br>

            if Zeus had not noticed with his noos, taking note in his thûmos.<br>

            First, he sent Iris, with the golden wings, to summon<br>

315       Demeter with the splendid hair, with a beauty that is much loved.<br>

            That is what he told her to do. And she obeyed Zeus, the one with the dark clouds, the son of Kronos,<br>

            and she ran the space between sky and earth quickly with her feet.<br>

            She arrived at the city of Eleusis, fragrant with incense,<br>

            and she found in the temple Demeter, the one with the dark robe.<br>

320       Addressing her, she spoke winged words:<br>

            “Demeter! Zeus, the one who has unwilting knowledge, summons you<br>

            to come to that special group, the company of the immortal gods.<br>

            So then, come! May what my words say, which come from Zeus, not fail to be turned into action that is completed.”<br>

            So she spoke, making an entreaty. But her thûmos was not persuaded.<br>

325       After that, the Father sent out all the other blessed and immortal gods.<br>

            They came one by one,<br>

            they kept calling out to her, offering many beautiful gifts,<br>

            all sorts of tîmai that she could choose for herself if she joined the company of the immortal gods.<br>

            But no one could persuade her in her thinking or in her intention,<br>

330       angry as she was in her thûmos, and she harshly said no to their words.<br>

            She said that she would never go to fragrant Olympus,<br>

            that she would never send up the harvest of the earth,<br>

            until she saw with her own eyes her daughter, the one with the beautiful looks.<br>

            But when the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide, heard this,<br>

335       he sent to Erebos [Hadês] the one with the golden wand, the Argos-killer<br>

            so that he may persuade Hadês, with gentle words,<br>

            that he allow holy Persephone to leave the misty realms of darkness<br>

            and be brought up to the light in order to join the daimones [the gods in Olympus], so that her mother may<br>

            see her with her own eyes and then let go of her anger.<br>

340       Hermes did not disobey, but straightaway he headed down beneath the depths of the earth,<br>

            rushing full speed, leaving behind the abode of Olympus.<br>

            And he found the Lord inside his palace,<br>

            seated on a funeral couch, along with his duly acquired bedmate,<br>

            the one who was much under duress, yearning for her mother, and suffering from the unbearable things<br>

345       inflicted on her by the will of the blessed ones.<br>

            Going near him [Hadês] and stopping, the powerful Argos-killer said to him:<br>

            “Hadês! Dark-haired one! King of the dead!<br>

            Zeus the Father orders that I have splendid Persephone<br>

            brought back up to light from Erebos back to him and his company, so that her mother<br>

350       may see her with her own eyes and let go of her wrath and terrible mênis<br>

            against the immortals. For she [Demeter] is performing a mighty deed,<br>

            to destroy [root phthi-] the tribes of earth-born humans, causing them to be without menos,<br>

            by hiding the Seed underground—and she is destroying the tîmai<br>

            of the immortal gods.[41] She has a terrible anger, and she refuses<br>

355       to keep company with the gods. Instead, far removed, she is seated inside<br>

            a temple fragrant with incense. She has taken charge of the rocky citadel of Eleusis.”<br>

            So he spoke. Hadês, King of the Dead, smiled<br>

            with his brows, and he did not disobey the order of Zeus the King.<br>

            Swiftly he gave an order to bright-minded Persephone.<br>

360       “Go, Persephone, to your mother, the one with the dark robe.<br>

            Have a kindly disposition and thûmos in your breast.<br>

            Do not be too upset, excessively so.<br>

            I will not be an unseemly husband to you, in the company of the immortals.<br>

            I am the brother of Zeus the Father. If you are here,<br>

365       you will be queen of everything that lives and moves about,<br>

            and you will have the greatest tîmai in the company of the immortals.<br>

            Those who violate dikê– will get punishment for all days to come<br>

            —those who do not supplicate your menos with sacrifice,<br>

            performing the rituals in a reverent way, executing perfectly the offerings that are due.”<br>

370       So he spoke. And high-minded Persephone rejoiced.<br>

            Swiftly she set out, with joy. But he<br>

            gave her, stealthily, the honey-sweet berry of the pomegranate to eat,<br>

            peering around him.[43] He did not want her to stay for all time<br>

            over there, at the side of her honorable mother, the one with the dark robe.<br>

375       The immortal horses were harnessed to the golden chariot<br>

            by Hadês, the one who makes many sêmata.<br>

            She got up on the chariot, and next to her was the powerful Argos-killer,<br>

            who took reins and whip into his philai hands<br>

            and shot out of the palace [of Hadês]. And the horses sped away eagerly.<br>

380       Swiftly they made their way along the long journey. Neither the sea<br>

            nor the water of the rivers nor the grassy valleys<br>

            nor the mountain peaks could hold up the onrush of the immortal horses.<br>

            High over the peaks they went, slicing through the vast air.<br>

            He came to a halt at the place where Demeter, with the beautiful garlands in the hair,<br>

385       was staying, at the forefront of the temple fragrant with incense. When she [Demeter] saw them,<br>

            she rushed forth like a maenad[44] down a wooded mountainslope.<br>



387-400



401       But when the earth starts blossoming with fragrant flowers of springtime,<br>

            flowers of every sort, then it is that you must come up from the misty realms of darkness,<br>

            once again, a great thing of wonder to gods and mortal humans alike.<br>

            But what kind of ruse was used to deceive you by the powerful one, the one who receives many guests?”<br>

405       She [Demeter] was answered by Persephone, the most beautiful:<br>

            “So then, Mother, I shall tell you everything, without error.<br>

            When the messenger came to me, the swift Argos-killer,<br>

            with the news from my father, the son of Kronos, and from the other dwellers in the sky,<br>

            that I should come from Erebos, so that you may see me with your own eyes<br>

410       and let go of your wrath and terrible mênis against the immortals,<br>

            then I sprang up for joy, but he, stealthily,<br>

            put into my hand the berry of the pomegranate, that honey-sweet food,<br>

            and he compelled me by biâ to eat of it.<br>

            As for how it was that he [Hadês] snatched me away, through the mêtis of the son of Kronos,<br>

415       my father, and how he took me down beneath the depths of the earth,<br>

            I will tell you and relate in order, as you ask.<br>

            We were, all of us, going along the lovely meadow, I and<br>

            Leukippê, Phainô, Elektra, Ianthê,<br>

            Melitê, Iakhê, Rhodeia, Kallirrhoê,<br>

420       Mêlobosis, Tychê, and flower-faced Okyrrhoê,<br>

            Chryseis, Ianeira, Akastê, Admêtê,<br>

            Rhodopê, Ploutô, and lovely Kalypsô,<br>

            Styx, Ourania, and lovely Galaxaura.<br>

            Also Pallas [Athena], the one who rouses to battle, and Artemis, who delights in arrows.<br>

425       We were playing and gathering lovely flowers in our hands,<br>

            an assortment of delicate crocus, iris, and hyacinth,<br>

            rosebuds and lilies, a wonder to behold,<br>

            and the narcissus, which is grown, like the crocus, by the wide earth.<br>

            I was joyfully gathering the flowers, and then the earth beneath me<br>

430       gave way, and there it was that he sprang out, the powerful lord who receives many guests.<br>

            He took me away under the earth in his golden chariot.<br>

            It was very much against my will. I cried with a piercing voice.<br>

            These things, grieving, I tell you, and they are all alêthea.”<br>

            In this way did the two of them spend the whole day, having a like-minded thûmos,<br>

435       and they gladdened greatly each other’s heart and thûmos,<br>

            hugging each other, and their thûmos ceased having akhos.<br>

            They received joy from each other, and gave it.<br>

            Then Hekatê approached them, the one with the splendid headband.<br>

            And she welcomed back the daughter of holy Demeter with many embraces.<br>

440       And from that day forward, the Lady [Hekatê] became her [Persephone’s] attendant and substitute queen.<br>

            Then the loud-thundering Zeus, who sees far and wide, sent to them a messenger,<br>

            Rhea with the beautiful hair, to bring Demeter, the one with the dark robe,<br>

            to join the company of the special group of gods. And he promised tîmai<br>

            that he would give to her [Demeter], which she could receive in the company of the immortal gods.<br>

445       He [Zeus] assented that her daughter, every time the season came round,<br>

            would spend a third portion of the year in the realms of dark mist underneath,<br>

            and the other two thirds in the company of her mother and the other immortals.<br>

            So he spoke, and the goddess [Rhea] did not disobey the messages of Zeus.<br>

            Swiftly she darted off from the peaks of Olympus<br>

450       and arrived at the Rarian Field,[49] the life-bringing fertile spot of land,<br>

            in former times, at least. But, at this time, it was no longer life-bringing, but it stood idle<br>

            and completely without green growth. The bright grain of wheat had stayed hidden underneath,<br>

            through the mental power of Demeter, the one with the beautiful ankles. But, from this point on,<br>

            it began straightaway to flourish with long ears of grain<br>

455       as the springtime was increasing its power. On the field, the fertile furrows<br>

            began to be overflow with cut-down ears of grain lying on the ground, while the rest of what was cut down was already bound into sheaves.<br>

            This happened the moment she [Rhea] arrived from the boundless aether.<br>

            They [Demeter and Rhea] were glad to see each other, and they rejoiced in their thûmos.<br>

            Then Rhea, the one with the splendid headband, addressed her [Demeter]:<br>

460       “Come, child, Zeus the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide, is summoning you<br>

            to come to the company of that special group of gods. And he promised tîmai<br>

            that he would give you, which you could receive in the company of the immortal gods.<br>

            He [Zeus] assented that your daughter, every time the season comes round,<br>

            would spend a third portion of the year in the realms of dark mist underneath,<br>

465       and the other two thirds in your company and that of the other immortals.<br>

            He has assented to all this with the nod of his head.<br>

            So come, my child! Obey! Do not be too<br>

            stubborn in your anger at the dark-clouded son of Kronos.<br>

            Straightaway make the harvest grow, that life-bringer for humans.”<br>

470       So she spoke, and Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in her hair, did not disobey.<br>

            Straightaway she sent up the harvest from the land with its rich clods of earth.<br>

            And all the wide earth with leaves and blossoms<br>

            was laden. Then she went to the kings, administrators of themistes,<br>

            and she showed them—to Triptolemos, to Diokles, driver of horses,<br>

475       to powerful Eumolpos and to Keleos, leader of the people [lâoi]—<br>

            she revealed to them the way to perform the sacred rites, and she pointed out the ritual to all of them<br>

            —the holy ritual, which it is not at all possible to ignore, to find out about,<br>

            or to speak out. The great awe of the gods holds back any speaking out.<br>

480       Olbios among earth-bound mortals is he who has seen these things.<br>

            But whoever is uninitiated in the rites, whoever takes no part in them, will never get a share [aisa] of those sorts of things [that the initiated get],<br>

            once they die, down below in the dank realms of mist.<br>

            But when the resplendent goddess finished all her instructions,<br>

            they [Demeter and Persephone] went to Olympus, to join the company of the other gods.<br>

485       And there they abide at the side of Zeus, who delights in the thunderbolt.<br>

            Holy they are, and revered. Olbios is he whom they,<br>

            being kind, decide to love among earth-bound mortals.<br>

            Straightaway they send to such a man, to reside at his hearth, in his great palace,<br>

            Ploutos [Wealth personified], who gives riches to mortal humans.<br>

490       But come, you goddesses, who have charge of the dêmos of Eleusis, fragrant with incense.<br>

            and of Paros the island and rocky Antron.<br>

            Come, O lady resplendent with gifts, queen Dêô [Demeter], bringer of hôrai,<br>

            both you and your daughter, the most beautiful Persephone.<br>

            Think kindly and grant, in return for this song, a rich means of livelihood that suits the thûmos.<br>

495       And I will keep you in mind throughout the rest of my song.</p>
